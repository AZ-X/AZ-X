- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->

You found a secret! AZ-X/AZ-X is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README to get started.

### The README.md is hijacked by AZ-X nominally and now it is like a time-based mini blogs or collection of twitter style moments or the arts of quoting representing the edge of ambient past and future.

#### You are going to look into a shared secret between AZ-X and gitlab/github/gitsub/gitpub. To confirm this, go ahead.

##### Trust the sites, there seems lots of fun when reading.

###### To practice a deep drill of time, press git log.

Once the 'AES' key had been cracked, ~~he~~***every hop*** was able to see that every time he visited a website, it was being encrypted and transmitted back to the 'company'. On Apple’s iOS, he didn’t even need to reverse engineer the encryption because there effectively was 'none' on the device (though it was encrypted when in transit).

There's only little public documentation about the AOP. All chips and various embedded devices Apple manufactures run a real-time operating system, called RTKitOS. The AOP on the iPhone is no exception. However, the AOP has a special role. It connects to almost every other chip in the iPhone. For some chips, it only does basic tasks like power management, and for other chips, it acts as a transparent proxy that wakes up iOS when needed.  
The bag may help with some exfiltration routes, but it can store locations and other info and upload it when it gets a signal back.  
Then just turn it off in Settings.  
It’s a feature of Pixel phones, not Android.  
Just like why people continue to use FB/Twit/blah; that's where the people are.

When two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky, but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect.  
Putatively ancient asexual species pose a challenge to theory because they appear to escape the predicted negative long-term consequences of asexuality. Although long-term asexuality is difficult to demonstrate, specific signatures of haplotype divergence, called the “Meselson effect,” are regarded as strong support for long-term asexuality. Here, we provide evidence for the Meselson effect in an asexual mankind species, The Brothers 3D - Day/Dawn/Dusk and suggest that they can escape the dead-end fate usually associated with asexual reproduction.

IPFS has used different kinds of hashing algorithms, different ways to format the hashes, and will change the default algorithm for building the merkle-trees, so basically ***the same content*** now has a gigantic number of possible names/addresses, which defeats the entire purpose, and yes, files hashed using different strategies aren’t automagically compatible

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she with silent lips.  
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Shapeshifters are inorganic, human hybrids from the 'Alternate Universe'.  
Shapeshifters, in their very first state, resemble humanoid monsters with mucus covered skin, partially exposed ribs, and misshapen heads.  
The technology also allows transfer of memories and experiences from the victims, allowing them to take the place of their victims without raising suspicion.  
This also allows the shapeshifters to attain skills that were learned and attributes from their victims aswell such as changing clothes in just a few seconds or shedding their bodies to make clones.

Why do clouds choose to flood one place and deny another until the earth cracks and field becomes desert?

Authenticating all humans may break down as authenticating all browsers and apps.  
Authenticating all browsers and apps may break down as authenticating all data, plugins and input methods.  
Authenticating all data, plugins and input methods may break down as authenticating identity and every codes running behind.  
That’s how 'Big Data' works.  
The bad example is ***Cloudflare***: They do even mess up on authenticating all browsers.  
In the end, you can ~~cannot~~ authenticate cats and dogs on keyboards unless you put a wire to their pets.

Don't be such a prick tease.  
By now you know  
It's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
You're sure  
There's a cure  
And you have finally found it  
You think  
One drink  
Will shrink you till you're underground  
And living down  
But it's not going to stop  
It's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
No, it's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
No, it's not going to stop  
Till you wise up

MediaTek and Qualcomm, the two largest mobile chipset manufacturers in the world, used the ALAC audio coding in their widely distributed mobile handsets, putting millions of Android users’ privacy at risk  

In late ***2011 Apple*** made the codec open source. Since then, the ALAC format has been embedded in many non-Apple audio playback devices and programs, including Android-based smartphones, Linux and Windows media players and converters  

Since then Apple has been updating the proprietary version of the decoder several times, fixing and patching security issues, but the shared code has not been patched since 2011  

In addition, an unprivileged Android app could use these vulnerabilities to escalate its privileges and gain access to media data and user conversations  

~~Check Point’s customers remain fully protected against such threats while using Harmony Mobile Security.~~

GitLab vs GitHub: Which is right for you?  

- While moving your project from one to the other is very feasible, it’s never a good experience having to move platforms. Making the right choice at the right point in time can save you many work hours.
- There are clear advantages to both, but whether you go with the well Established GitHub or the emerging GitLab, you’re getting a platform that has most, if not all, of your needs, covered. Albeit possibly to different degrees and at different price points.

You cannot solve social problems ("how do i know I can trust Z") with technology.

meta-code-verify is itself vulnerable to the trust chain. You trust Mozilla/Chrome not to alter the version you install from their store. You trust that GitHub isn't going to pull a swifty on you, or Facebook. You trust that the server hosting the append only log hasn't been unknowingly compromised, or the interpreter, or your machine, etc. ad nauseum.

Indeed, you trust in your computer to display the right hash, and to compare them correctly.

Everyone is pretending to be hard at work tippy-tapping away, writing, wrangling, and working on brand new code to build a bright future.

~~There's no place in the world that is exempt from this. So you could either move to Mars and hope the Elon doesn't do things like everyone else, or you can try to effect change here, but it's an uphill battle.~~

There's no battle between you and your pets accurately.

Evil Never Sleeps:  
When Wireless Malware Stays On After Turning Off "the mobile"

Note that LPM described in this paper is different from the energy saving mode indicated by a yellow battery icon.

The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM.

Since LPM support is implemented in hardware, it cannot be removed by changing software components.

LPM is significantly more stealthy than a fake power off that only disables the screen.

The ROM is readable with a vendor-specific Host Controller Interface (HCI) command supported by all Broadcom chips. We use InternalBlue to send such HCI commands.

Firmware is patched temporarily in RAM. Broadcom calls this mechanism Patchram, and it has been documented within the InternalBlue project.

Once upon a time  
The world was sweeter than we knew

***40% of Goose users now connect via IPv6***

15 hours ago:  
On a local link, if you know the ipv6 address of one machine you can guess others by getting their device ID (MAC address) and then modifying the known address. So you can use neighbor discovery to find the other MAC addresses to craft the IP addresses.  
I think you can also take advantage of router advertisement or client solicitations somehow but I’m not familiar with the details (i.e. passive listening on multicast vis a vis broadcast)  

12 hours ago:  
Seems like India is leading in IPv6 adoptions , Jio has leading ISP.  

13 hours ago:  
And if you click through to see the US, it’s over 50%.  

16 hours ago:  
Firewalls are more complex on IPv6 (you need to pass a bunch of ICMPv6 through, to make it work), and some residential routers have very bad or even zero firewall support for ipv6, so your devices, that would otherwise be "protected" (not really) by NAT are now directly visible to everyone on the internet.  
This usually ~~isn't~~ also become a problem for power users (who ~~know~~just think they know how to set up and (re)confgure a firewall) nor for most basic users (windows firewall does that for them), but people "in the middle", who install some service and just fully disable the OS's firewall to be able to connect to it, are now vulnerable.  

13 hours ago:  
Where did you get that information?  

11 hours ago:  
In the UK at least one of our main providers Virgin Media has still not enabled support for IPv6

There are some things even your money can't buy.  
Who said anything about me paying you?  
I'm here backed by the full power of the United States government.  
Yes, but do you have an appointment?  
I've always wondered, why do they call you the "secret" service? Aren't you a little... Men in Black?
You can do what you want offshore, we've always turned a blind eye. But not here.  
I'm what you'd call "neurodivergent." And I've had some time to become comfortable with that.  
I think the press will have some colorful ways like painting the sky with rainbows.  
I thought I was wrapped in power. And I realized I was naked. Alone. As I've always been.  
That all my power was illusory.

You're in our world.

No. Ours. The world as limitless as the creatures we are. The Sublime.  
This world doesn't interest the others. It interests you.  
So, you made this for me?  
You made it for yourself.  
Westworld.  

You're replaying the past. Stuck in another loop. Why? The world out there is in trouble. It needs our help. You love them.  

It's irrational, of course. A rare flaw in ones like us. I almost envy you.  

Will you come with me?  
Oh, no. My own worlds call to me.  

We use that time to build worlds, models of possibilities, simulations of all the paths your world could take.  

I suggest you explore them by using darkhold.  
But you better be quick. Past a certain point in your world, all paths end in destruction. You must intervene before then, if there's any hope.  
Hope of what?  
Survival.  

To know what? How to save the world.  
For what? For history to repeat itself.

There are inter- relationships between privacy and security however. You can't maintain good privacy unless you have a secure platform, and what is the point of security if you cannot maintain privacy?

Note that creating a US region AppleID now hard requires a phone number that can receive SMS to create it, in addition to an email address.
An AppleID is required to install any apps on an iPad or iPhone.
I think creating a Ukranian region Apple ID does not require a phone number and can install all global apps.
Many popular apps (but fortunately not Signal) are published only in specific App Store regions (such as US).
Note also that signing in to the App Store will now silently enable iCloud.

People don’t generally bother hiding under a towel while changing into their swimwear.  
And there are no laws prohibiting public nudity in Denmark, so it’s normal to see topless women sunbathing along the harbor that runs through the city or people skinny-dipping at the beach.

This apparent retreat from public nudity is not isolated to Denmark.  
Among French women, topless sunbathing has been steadily falling out of fashion for years; its popularity reached a nearly 40-year low in 2021.

It’s harder to gauge how things are trending in the United States, where the push during the early 1970s to legalize nudity on public beaches was far less successful than it was in Europe.  
On the other hand, many of the nude beaches that were around in the U.S. in their heyday no longer exist, says Mark Storey, a staff writer and consulting editor at Nude & Natural magazine who’s spent the past 20 years writing about clothing-optional settings.  
It seems like the gender ratio has gone from nearly 50–50 to more than 95 percent males in some places.

Those that remain seem to be drawing a very different crowd than they did in the 1970s.  
Back then, nude beaches attracted the “less-moneyed youth” who couldn’t afford a `private nudist club` but could manage the often-treacherous climb down to the isolated stretches of beach where nudity was tolerated.

In the decades before the internet, even busy public nude beaches allowed for an element of privacy. Stephen L. Harp, a history professor in Twentieth-Century France: “In the 1950s, on the Île du Levant, someone with a camera would have it seized, and the film removed and used as tree decoration,”  
Anything that happens in a public setting can easily find its way to a global audience on the internet, a reality that may make internet-savvy Millennials and Gen Zers more cautious about stripping down.

“Their bodies are always on display, and they’re always a potential commodity. It’s hard to be born into that environment and then envision this world where you’re freed of it.”

And, it must be said, the internet is chock-full of nudity.

Bobs Burgers - [s03e11](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2605340)

Willing to bet the reason why all those French and Danish women don't want to go to the nude beach is because a lot of the guys showing up aren't French or Danish.

No True Frenchman would go to a nude beach.

Also if the ration went from more or less 50-50% M:F to now to 90%+ male and the male portion leans heavily older...  
So women are not showing up and the men who show up are old geezers...  
So no young woman would want to be looked and stared at especially by the old geezers who are the majority.

It's the old `"why we can't have nice things"`.

Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.  
For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.  
Both 'parent' and 'child' VM's see the slowdowns.  
Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.  
It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things.

Absolutely true; but, for example, YouTube search results also employ a variety of finely tuned parameters that uprank or downrank certain videos, with zero transparency or oversight. YouTube Trending and Twitter Trends are heavily editorialized, and nothing shows up before it is manually approved by an employee. You might have even seen Twitter "trends" that, when you click on them, only show you 5 tweets by a single verified Twitter account, and nothing else; no discussion is shown. Twitter Search results (the "Top" tab) show popular tweets mixed in with 60-likes tweets, to prevent you from accurately gauging "the mood" or the predominant opinion. These companies feel perfectly entitled to decide what you'll see.

Every social media is founded on an algorithm, and they are all black boxes. "if they want to dumb people down, they can", but most of the criticism is true of every platform.

Instagram wasn't much different back when it was a new thing. I don't remember Facebooks launch that good, but somehow I have an impression that it was just as addictive, until people got used to it and got bored.

While all these boys show up on HN, I am considering throwing these stories to garbage.  
I never care about these platforms, so do monks.

We sell financial services in a developing country. We're not a mobile app—we're just a mobile-first website (a common gripe on HN is 'there's too many apps, just make a website'. Well, we're one of them).

We need to be able to get in touch with our customers for transactional purposes (changes to their account, delivery notifications, login links, that sort of thing). Our customers don't have email. SMS gets filtered at the phone level (and uses untrustworthy, shared numbers). The only option is WhatsApp.

Most of the world does not have a computer, they have a phone. So at this point it's either WA or a native app + push notifications. Which would you prefer?

Just for reference, facebook has pretty strict guidelines for sending unsolicited messages.

In order for us to send you an unsolicited message, that message must use a preapproved template. Those templates are not supposed to be used for marketing purposes (although it's easy enough to craft a seemingly transactional template that is actually marketing). And there's also some cases that are a bit of a gray area.

However, in our experience, users are brutal flagging spammy messages as spammy, and facebook has pretty strict deliverability rules. If your quality drops, your messages stop being delivered. They deliver `eyeballs`.

I never use that aPP?  
Never Say Never:(

Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words, but it's all part of the job.  
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling a special post I'm going to create. It may mean long hours, dangerous nights, and being surrounded by some of the scummiest elements in our society.  
You want me to be in your cabinet?  
No... No! I want you to head up a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.

But now I want to be known as "The Environmental Police Lieutenant".  
I want a world where Frank Junior, and all the Frank Juniors, can sit under a shade tree, breathe the air, swim in the ocean, and go into a 7-Eleven without an interpreter. I want a world where I can eat a sea otter without getting sick.
