Does it also work with Google (company that pays hundreds of millions to Mozilla) cookies?

Why people use [mrustc](https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc) a.k.a. alternative rust compiler to build Firefox?  
Why people hate multiple Objective Caml builds?

Considering that BoringSSL is the library in Chrome, Android, iOS, and Google's GFE, I imagine it's adoption is not "poor". It is probably the most widespread TLS implementation, by traffic.

Why github show an example of [Deleted bot](https://github.com/ghost) talking about terms of 'blacklisting' or 'whitelisting' [ghostly](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/issues/1654)  
Why ask to open a ghostliness discussion on such topic?

Once the 'AES' key had been cracked, ~~he~~***every hop*** was able to see that every time he visited a website, it was being encrypted and transmitted back to the 'company'. On Apple’s iOS, he didn’t even need to reverse engineer the encryption because there effectively was 'none' on the device (though it was encrypted when in transit).

This is the lamest title i ever read  
Rust? what is that?  
1.55.0 why is that worth mentioning  
Is this an AD? or a news about an update?  
Why not mention it's an update and is a release note?  
or is ***Hacker News*** the place to release rust release notes so mentioning it would imply it is not  
Fishy fishy, when i hold your tail, you start to stray away, or not, doesn't make sense anyways, does it?

it's able to silently pull a *trove* of personal information without _any_ kind of user prompt  
All this data was being collected and available to an attacker even if “Share analytics” was turned off in ***settings***.” states the expert.  
```
func wifi_info() -> String? {
    let connection = xpc_connection_create_mach_service("com.apple.nehelper", nil, 2)
    xpc_connection_set_event_handler(connection, { _ in })
    xpc_connection_resume(connection)
    let xdict = xpc_dictionary_create(nil, nil, 0)

    xpc_dictionary_set_string(xdict, "interface-name", "en0")
    let reply = xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync(connection, xdict)
    if let result = xpc_dictionary_get_value(reply, "result-data") {
        let ssid = String(cString: xpc_dictionary_get_string(result, "SSID"))

There's only little public documentation about the AOP. All chips and various embedded devices Apple manufactures run a real-time operating system, called RTKitOS. The AOP on the iPhone is no exception. However, the AOP has a special role. It connects to almost every other chip in the iPhone. For some chips, it only does basic tasks like power management, and for other chips, it acts as a transparent proxy that wakes up iOS when needed.  
The bag may help with some exfiltration routes, but it can store locations and other info and upload it when it gets a signal back.  
Then just turn it off in Settings.  
It’s a feature of Pixel phones, not Android.  
Just like why people continue to use FB/Twit/blah; that's where the people are.

When two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky, but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect.  
Putatively ancient asexual species pose a challenge to theory because they appear to escape the predicted negative long-term consequences of asexuality. Although long-term asexuality is difficult to demonstrate, specific signatures of haplotype divergence, called the “Meselson effect,” are regarded as strong support for long-term asexuality. Here, we provide evidence for the Meselson effect in an asexual mankind species, The Brothers 3D - Day/Dawn/Dusk and suggest that they can escape the dead-end fate usually associated with asexual reproduction.

1.0  
New features:  
- [x] Future foresight
- [x] Communication with up to seven deceased relatives and wireless compatibility

To update overnight say 'yes' at the tone.  
I see you pay for the "cloud" monthly, so at least you have a backup of your good deeds and sins. ~~Can you see my sins? You want me to?~~ We can offer you a discount on a new system. You're supposed to renew your faith every 18 months???  

2.0  
Wireless, waterproof, non-flammable and simply indestructible  
Can you see me? Yes, I see everything. The new is equipped with visual sensor technology.  
Turn off. The new has an eternal battery life and can't be powered down. Forever in your presence making you a better prison, always.  
No, no, no, no, no, no! [mini nested echoes]  

It's been pretty hectic around here.  
You are categorized as low-level maintenance crew. An android companion is not an ‘approved expense’. You were registered at a cost of $500,000. The android cost $40 million. Please get us those reading STAT.
