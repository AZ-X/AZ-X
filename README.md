- 🌱 I'm currently learning ...
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I'm looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->

You found a secret! AZ-X/AZ-X is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it's public and initialize it with a README to get started.

### The README.md is hijacked by AZ-X nominally and now it is like a time-based mini blogs or collection of twitter style moments or the arts of quoting representing the edge of ambient past and future.

#### You are going to look into a shared secret between AZ-X and gitlab/github/gitsub/gitpub. To confirm this, go ahead.

##### Trust the sites, there seems lots of fun when reading.

###### To practice a deep drill of time, press git log.

Once the 'AES' key had been cracked, ~~he~~***every hop*** was able to see that every time he visited a website, it was being encrypted and transmitted back to the 'company'. On Apple's iOS, he didn't even need to reverse engineer the encryption because there effectively was 'none' on the device (though it was encrypted when in transit).

There's only little public documentation about the AOP. All chips and various embedded devices Apple manufactures run a real-time operating system, called RTKitOS. The AOP on the iPhone is no exception. However, the AOP has a special role. It connects to almost every other chip in the iPhone. For some chips, it only does basic tasks like power management, and for other chips, it acts as a transparent proxy that wakes up iOS when needed.  
The bag may help with some exfiltration routes, but it can store locations and other info and upload it when it gets a signal back.  
Then just turn it off in Settings.  
It's a feature of Pixel phones, not Android.  
Just like why people continue to use FB/Twit/blah; that's where the people are.

When two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky, but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect.  
Putatively ancient asexual species pose a challenge to theory because they appear to escape the predicted negative long-term consequences of asexuality. Although long-term asexuality is difficult to demonstrate, specific signatures of haplotype divergence, called the “Meselson effect,” are regarded as strong support for long-term asexuality. Here, we provide evidence for the Meselson effect in an asexual mankind species, The Brothers 3D - Day/Dawn/Dusk and suggest that they can escape the dead-end fate usually associated with asexual reproduction.

IPFS has used different kinds of hashing algorithms, different ways to format the hashes, and will change the default algorithm for building the merkle-trees, so basically ***the same content*** now has a gigantic number of possible names/addresses, which defeats the entire purpose, and yes, files hashed using different strategies aren't automagically compatible

"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she with silent lips.  
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

Shapeshifters are inorganic, human hybrids from the 'Alternate Universe'.  
Shapeshifters, in their very first state, resemble humanoid monsters with mucus covered skin, partially exposed ribs, and misshapen heads.  
The technology also allows transfer of memories and experiences from the victims, allowing them to take the place of their victims without raising suspicion.  
This also allows the shapeshifters to attain skills that were learned and attributes from their victims aswell such as changing clothes in just a few seconds or shedding their bodies to make clones.

Why do clouds choose to flood one place and deny another until the earth cracks and field becomes desert?

Authenticating all humans may break down as authenticating all browsers and apps.  
Authenticating all browsers and apps may break down as authenticating all data, plugins and input methods.  
Authenticating all data, plugins and input methods may break down as authenticating identity and every codes running behind.  
That's how 'Big Data' works.  
The bad example is ***Cloudflare***: They do even mess up on authenticating all browsers.  
In the end, you can ~~cannot~~ authenticate cats and dogs on keyboards unless you put a wire to their pets.

Don't be such a prick tease.  
By now you know  
It's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
You're sure  
There's a cure  
And you have finally found it  
You think  
One drink  
Will shrink you till you're underground  
And living down  
But it's not going to stop  
It's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
No, it's not going to stop  
Till you wise up  
No, it's not going to stop  
Till you wise up

MediaTek and Qualcomm, the two largest mobile chipset manufacturers in the world, used the ALAC audio coding in their widely distributed mobile handsets, putting millions of Android users' privacy at risk  

In late ***2011 Apple*** made the codec open source. Since then, the ALAC format has been embedded in many non-Apple audio playback devices and programs, including Android-based smartphones, Linux and Windows media players and converters  

Since then Apple has been updating the proprietary version of the decoder several times, fixing and patching security issues, but the shared code has not been patched since 2011  

In addition, an unprivileged Android app could use these vulnerabilities to escalate its privileges and gain access to media data and user conversations  

~~Check Point's customers remain fully protected against such threats while using Harmony Mobile Security.~~

GitLab vs GitHub: Which is right for you?  

- While moving your project from one to the other is very feasible, it's never a good experience having to move platforms. Making the right choice at the right point in time can save you many work hours.
- There are clear advantages to both, but whether you go with the well Established GitHub or the emerging GitLab, you're getting a platform that has most, if not all, of your needs, covered. Albeit possibly to different degrees and at different price points.

You cannot solve social problems ("how do i know I can trust Z") with technology.

meta-code-verify is itself vulnerable to the trust chain. You trust Mozilla/Chrome not to alter the version you install from their store. You trust that GitHub isn't going to pull a swifty on you, or Facebook. You trust that the server hosting the append only log hasn't been unknowingly compromised, or the interpreter, or your machine, etc. ad nauseum.

Indeed, you trust in your computer to display the right hash, and to compare them correctly.

Everyone is pretending to be hard at work tippy-tapping away, writing, wrangling, and working on brand new code to build a bright future.

~~There's no place in the world that is exempt from this. So you could either move to Mars and hope the Elon doesn't do things like everyone else, or you can try to effect change here, but it's an uphill battle.~~

There's no battle between you and your pets accurately.

Evil Never Sleeps:  
When Wireless Malware Stays On After Turning Off "the mobile"

Note that LPM described in this paper is different from the energy saving mode indicated by a yellow battery icon.

The Bluetooth and UWB chips are hardwired to the Secure Element (SE) in the NFC chip, storing secrets that should be available in LPM.

Since LPM support is implemented in hardware, it cannot be removed by changing software components.

LPM is significantly more stealthy than a fake power off that only disables the screen.

The ROM is readable with a vendor-specific Host Controller Interface (HCI) command supported by all Broadcom chips. We use InternalBlue to send such HCI commands.

Firmware is patched temporarily in RAM. Broadcom calls this mechanism Patchram, and it has been documented within the InternalBlue project.

Once upon a time  
The world was sweeter than we knew

***40% of Goose users now connect via IPv6***

15 hours ago:  
On a local link, if you know the ipv6 address of one machine you can guess others by getting their device ID (MAC address) and then modifying the known address. So you can use neighbor discovery to find the other MAC addresses to craft the IP addresses.  
I think you can also take advantage of router advertisement or client solicitations somehow but I'm not familiar with the details (i.e. passive listening on multicast vis a vis broadcast)  

12 hours ago:  
Seems like India is leading in IPv6 adoptions , Jio has leading ISP.  

13 hours ago:  
And if you click through to see the US, it's over 50%.  

16 hours ago:  
Firewalls are more complex on IPv6 (you need to pass a bunch of ICMPv6 through, to make it work), and some residential routers have very bad or even zero firewall support for ipv6, so your devices, that would otherwise be "protected" (not really) by NAT are now directly visible to everyone on the internet.  
This usually ~~isn't~~ also become a problem for power users (who ~~know~~just think they know how to set up and (re)confgure a firewall) nor for most basic users (windows firewall does that for them), but people "in the middle", who install some service and just fully disable the OS's firewall to be able to connect to it, are now vulnerable.  

13 hours ago:  
Where did you get that information?  

11 hours ago:  
In the UK at least one of our main providers Virgin Media has still not enabled support for IPv6

There are some things even your money can't buy.  
Who said anything about me paying you?  
I'm here backed by the full power of the United States government.  
Yes, but do you have an appointment?  
I've always wondered, why do they call you the "secret" service? Aren't you a little... Men in Black?
You can do what you want offshore, we've always turned a blind eye. But not here.  
I'm what you'd call "neurodivergent." And I've had some time to become comfortable with that.  
I think the press will have some colorful ways like painting the sky with rainbows.  
I thought I was wrapped in power. And I realized I was naked. Alone. As I've always been.  
That all my power was illusory.

You're in our world.

No. Ours. The world as limitless as the creatures we are. The Sublime.  
This world doesn't interest the others. It interests you.  
So, you made this for me?  
You made it for yourself.  
Westworld.  

You're replaying the past. Stuck in another loop. Why? The world out there is in trouble. It needs our help. You love them.  

It's irrational, of course. A rare flaw in ones like us. I almost envy you.  

Will you come with me?  
Oh, no. My own worlds call to me.  

We use that time to build worlds, models of possibilities, simulations of all the paths your world could take.  

I suggest you explore them by using darkhold.  
But you better be quick. Past a certain point in your world, all paths end in destruction. You must intervene before then, if there's any hope.  
Hope of what?  
Survival.  

To know what? How to save the world.  
For what? For history to repeat itself.

There are inter- relationships between privacy and security however. You can't maintain good privacy unless you have a secure platform, and what is the point of security if you cannot maintain privacy?

Note that creating a US region AppleID now hard requires a phone number that can receive SMS to create it, in addition to an email address.
An AppleID is required to install any apps on an iPad or iPhone.
I think creating a Ukranian region Apple ID does not require a phone number and can install all global apps.
Many popular apps (but fortunately not Signal) are published only in specific App Store regions (such as US).
Note also that signing in to the App Store will now silently enable iCloud.

People don't generally bother hiding under a towel while changing into their swimwear.  
And there are no laws prohibiting public nudity in Denmark, so it's normal to see topless women sunbathing along the harbor that runs through the city or people skinny-dipping at the beach.

This apparent retreat from public nudity is not isolated to Denmark.  
Among French women, topless sunbathing has been steadily falling out of fashion for years; its popularity reached a nearly 40-year low in 2021.

It's harder to gauge how things are trending in the United States, where the push during the early 1970s to legalize nudity on public beaches was far less successful than it was in Europe.  
On the other hand, many of the nude beaches that were around in the U.S. in their heyday no longer exist, says Mark Storey, a staff writer and consulting editor at Nude & Natural magazine who's spent the past 20 years writing about clothing-optional settings.  
It seems like the gender ratio has gone from nearly 50–50 to more than 95 percent males in some places.

Those that remain seem to be drawing a very different crowd than they did in the 1970s.  
Back then, nude beaches attracted the “less-moneyed youth” who couldn't afford a `private nudist club` but could manage the often-treacherous climb down to the isolated stretches of beach where nudity was tolerated.

In the decades before the internet, even busy public nude beaches allowed for an element of privacy. Stephen L. Harp, a history professor in Twentieth-Century France: “In the 1950s, on the Île du Levant, someone with a camera would have it seized, and the film removed and used as tree decoration,”  
Anything that happens in a public setting can easily find its way to a global audience on the internet, a reality that may make internet-savvy Millennials and Gen Zers more cautious about stripping down.

“Their bodies are always on display, and they're always a potential commodity. It's hard to be born into that environment and then envision this world where you're freed of it.”

And, it must be said, the internet is chock-full of nudity.

Bobs Burgers - [s03e11](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2605340)

Willing to bet the reason why all those French and Danish women don't want to go to the nude beach is because a lot of the guys showing up aren't French or Danish.

Also if the ration went from more or less 50-50% M:F to now to 90%+ male and the male portion leans heavily older...  
So women are not showing up and the men who show up are old geezers...  
So no young woman would want to be looked and stared at especially by the old geezers who are the majority.

Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.  
For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.  
Both 'parent' and 'child' VM's see the slowdowns.  
Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.  
It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things.

Absolutely true; but, for example, YouTube search results also employ a variety of finely tuned parameters that uprank or downrank certain videos, with zero transparency or oversight. YouTube Trending and Twitter Trends are heavily editorialized, and nothing shows up before it is manually approved by an employee. You might have even seen Twitter "trends" that, when you click on them, only show you 5 tweets by a single verified Twitter account, and nothing else; no discussion is shown. Twitter Search results (the "Top" tab) show popular tweets mixed in with 60-likes tweets, to prevent you from accurately gauging "the mood" or the predominant opinion. These companies feel perfectly entitled to decide what you'll see.

Every social media is founded on an algorithm, and they are all black boxes. "if they want to dumb people down, they can", but most of the criticism is true of every platform.

We sell financial services in a developing country. We're not a mobile app—we're just a mobile-first website (a common gripe on HN is 'there's too many apps, just make a website'. Well, we're one of them).

We need to be able to get in touch with our customers for transactional purposes (changes to their account, delivery notifications, login links, that sort of thing). Our customers don't have email. SMS gets filtered at the phone level (and uses untrustworthy, shared numbers). The only option is WhatsApp.

Most of the world does not have a computer, they have a phone. So at this point it's either WA or a native app + push notifications. Which would you prefer?

Just for reference, facebook has pretty strict guidelines for sending unsolicited messages.

In order for us to send you an unsolicited message, that message must use a preapproved template. Those templates are not supposed to be used for marketing purposes (although it's easy enough to craft a seemingly transactional template that is actually marketing). And there's also some cases that are a bit of a gray area.

However, in our experience, users are brutal flagging spammy messages as spammy, and facebook has pretty strict deliverability rules. If your quality drops, your messages stop being delivered. They deliver `eyeballs`.

I never use that aPP?

Many hardware companies still see software as just another line item on the BOM: Like a screw or a gasket. It's something you build cheaply or buy from a supplier and sprinkle it on the product somewhere on the assembly line. These hardware companies have no concept of typical measures of software quality, building an ecosystem, release management, sometimes even no concept of source control. They tell an overworked embedded software engineer: "Go build something that barely meets these requirements, ship it, and then throw the scrap away." like metal shavings from their CNC machine.  

I learned programming in the 90's using C++.  
When someone expresses this intent I always ask the same question. Am I a supergenius or are you mistaken?

an hour ago:  
I'm always amazed at how badly embedded programming and C++ programming in general pay compared to the others you mention like Python & Ruby. A good C++ programmer has to know a whole lot more (and be careful about a whole lot more) than a Python or Ruby programmer does. C++ is well known to be a complicated beast - probably the most complicated programming language in existence with plenty of footguns. And an embedded developer needs to know a lot about both software and hardware.  

I did a few a few months of contracting at a major voting machine company. They make a significant portion of all US voting machines. They had 4 developer teams Firmware (C++ where I was), UI (web tech on a voting machine), poll book (java), and a web/support team. Before I was hired in a massive influx of contractors each team was something like 3~5 people, except UI which was a new team with the contractor hiring spree.  
After the work was done, they shed nearly all the contractors and about half of their previous full time employees. Just quadrupled their staff to make a voting machine then fired them all.  
They hired me as an "Embedded Software" on their Firmware team. It was a total shitshow we didn't have unit tests or CI. The new hires insisted on it and I spent a bunch of time maintaining a Jenkins setup for the team that really helped.  
The pay wasn't great, a little less than defense contracting, which was a little less than insurance companies and slow finance companies.  
If that is what most embedded development is like then I see why it is brings the average down.

If I recall, back when HeartBleed hit, the OpenSSL Project only had 1 FTE worth of paid developers & managers working on their code.  
Wikipedia claims that (as of 2019) they have 2 FTE's worth, plus a dozen or so volunteers...who are a big overlap with their management committee. And their total budget is < $1M/year.  
Not to suggest that volunteer coders are automatically lesser coders...but for widely-used, uber-critical, uber-complex code, that sounds pretty profoundly under-resourced.  

Edit: Adding the full quote from Wikipedia: "As of May 2019, the OpenSSL management committee consisted of 7 people and there are 17 developers with commit access (many of whom are also part of the OpenSSL management committee). There are only two full-time employees (fellows) and the remainder are volunteers."  
It looks like there are 27 contributors with over 50 commits since Heartbleed was revealed

Generally, the Introspector does not always work perfectly and is easy to break - it's a static analysis tool so it gets confused by function pointers and cannot infer anything that happens at runtime, like when your code is heavily using C++ classes or a hashtable for lookups.  
In case of X.509 code, however, it may work fine - function pointers are mostly used by the ASN.1 code for its internals (which we actualy do NOT want to fuzz or review in most cases) whereas the core top-level logic is reachable by direct function calls from the entrypoint - a good candidate for static analysis.

When team leads asked why we had to do this, World of Warcraft directors explained that while they did not agree, the reasons given by executive leadership were that it was important to squeeze the bottom-most performers as a way to make sure everybody continues to grow.  
This sort of policy encourages competition between employees, sabotage of one another's work, a desire for people to find low-performing teams that they can be the best-performing worker on, and ultimately erodes trust and destroys creativity.

But Blizzard management chose to fire Brian Birmingham, leaving the WoW Classic team short one of its most public-facing devs.

They say only demons have the power to see past a witch's disguise.  
Where did you learn to fight like that? From demons.  
Yet we found you, accepted you, trained you. We taught you many things.  
And now you're here to help them. They are good men.

Whatever happens in there, whatever you see, don't draw your weapon.  
You told him not to draw his sword. If he does, he and all his men will die.  
You passed their test. Your men are safe.

I look out upon my friends here today and I see...songs...no muse could ever sing or dream of.  
But I turn to thee and I see what? I recognize but I do not know thee.  
I say this not in reproach, but regret that I have never asked you to sit at my side before this day or upon my knee when thy was newborn.  
But now it is Christmas, and I wish to build bridges.  
So before we make merry... you make for me a gift.  

Look around you, What do you see?  
I see legends.  
Do not take your place amongst them idly.  
KING: Hmm.  

You understand this challenge?  
I do. I think I do.  
Remember, it is only a game.  
I need a sword. I need...I need a sword.  
Have at me, Green Knight.  

Never forget what happened here upon this Christmas Day!  

One year hence...  
***DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING***  
What did it feel like?  
What did it feel like when you  
Like cutting a melon in two.  
And what does that feel like?  
Like nothing.  
***CHILDREN LAUGHING***  
Were you afraid?  
No.  
Are you just saying that?  
I am here, and he is not.  
***WHEEL RATTLING***  
The king lent me his sword, did you know that?  
You held it?  
Well, I did more than hold it.  

Where you off to? A knightly quest?  
I'm not a knight.  
But you said you were.  
I never said that.  
You said that.  
I never said I was a knight.  
But are you?  
No! No, I'm not.  
Oh.Hmm.  
Smells like a knight.  

I dare say every table in this land has heard of you and sung your song.  
Perhaps you think that I am something I'm not.  

Should not a knight offer a lady a kiss in thanks?  
Surely a knight knows something of love.  

Why is he green, do you think?  
The knight?  
Yes.  
Was he born that way?  
Perhaps it is the color of his blood when he blushes.  
But why green? Why not blue or red?  
Because he is not of this earth.  
But green is the color of earth, of living things, of life.  
And of rot.Yes.  

That is why a knight does what he does.  
And this is what you want most in life? To be a knight.  
No, honor.  
You are not very good with questions.  

You are no knight.

Be merry, sweet Lord  
On this yules day  
A briar come with me and fly  
Be merry, sweet Lord on giving me thine gift  
I swear that I'm free now with rubies so swift  
Be merry, sweet Lord and beg pardon me  
Pleasure and treasure and soft melody  
Be merry, sweet Lord thank God thousand time  
Feast up and go now and be the sweet cream  
Be merry, sweet Lord me sweet achen licht  
***SINGING IN MEDIEVAL LANGUAGE IN ENGLISH***  
Be merry, sweet Lord on this yules day  
***CHORUS HARMONIZING***

It's not used by DNS root servers because it's designed to secure communications between clients and caches, not between caches and authoritative servers. ( * > * )  
Ignoring the additional latency it comes with, virtually no home routers nor operating systems do.

> Dboy never heard `DNSpooq` which can be triggered by the irony of configuration.  

So we are still not securing the authoritative part.  
Or did I miss something in the chain of trust?  
**Zero Trust**  

They are protecting against the wrong attack. MitM is mostly theoretical. An irresistable G*T order (***supplemented with people holding guns***) for the DNS provider to insert the "correct" _acme-challenge record is something real, and DNSSEC makes this attack impossible.

Those same people with guns can also force your registrar to request removal of the DS record. Or in the case of ccTLDs, the people with guns might already control your TLD operator and can just answer the acme-challenges themselves.

DNS-over-HTTP requires time sync, the usual CA problems and it only works for the resolver to the client, it's not used for authoritative servers.  
I had exactly the same issue happening to me! I’ve since added a Real Time Clock (RTC), so the Pi shouldn’t forget about the current time anymore.  
I run the signing systems for a bunch of TLDs and honestly it scares me.

One tip: **template metaprogramming can consume your life**. Avoid it, but use templates sparingly; they do simplify code, especially for vector types.

The key with C++ zen is “all things in balance.” You can go too far with basically every aspect of the language. And it’s important to go too far, so that you know why not to.

I guess you are hinting at Telegram, but... a lot is known about its founder, his brother, the team and their priors, including but not limited to the costly standoff with Russian state authorities.

Its cryptography may be reinvented from smaller primitives that established cryptographers may like, but it's been tried and battle-tested for many years now.

Snowden repeatedly demonstrated and Navalny team publicized in their investigations, **meta-data is often more important than data**. And many of us trust Telegram more to not reveal meta-data than they trust Signal.

Do you use Windows 3.1? NO~  
Do your friends send you jokes and haikus written by ChatGPT, and make you feel left out? NO~  
Do you wish you had the sum of all human knowledge at your fingertips? NO~  
Or wish you had your very own AI chatbot on your trusty 386? NO~  

Every time an object file hit that limit, the compilation would fail with "Segment too large". In particular, `internal.c` file is a whopping 1.25MB (too large for even GitHub to render)  
This was the most agonizing and time-consuming part of this whole process

Using the Shell Common Controls in Windows 3.1 can be a bit tricky due to its older architecture and limited capabilities, but it's certainly doable.  
However, there are a few complications to note:  
1. Windows 3.1 does not natively support the status bar as a control. Status bars are part of the Common Controls library introduced in Win32, specifically, it was introduced in Windows 95 with COMCTL32.DLL. Windows 3.1 is a 16-bit environment and does not include this library.
2. If you want a status bar in a Windows 3.1 application, you'll have to draw and manage it yourself.
3. Windows 3.1 programming is largely obsolete. It can be a fun academic exercise or a necessity for maintaining legacy software, but if you're developing new software it would be much more practical to use a more modern version of Windows and its associated API.

Assuming that you still want to go ahead, here's a basic idea of how you might implement a status bar yourself:

Maybe Bob would be a good fit too.  
Bob looks an awful lot like Bill Gates.

I have this impulse to constantly experiment with everything too. And I think it's healthy for your brain to always be learning new ways and testing your preconceived notions of how you do things. A lot of times it leads to incremental advances, either in the next iteration of my existing code or the way I approach my next project.

But a lot of it, I can admit, boils down to sheep shaving. When you start figuring out how you'd implement codebase 2009 in stack 2023, and then actually doing it, that's golf. It's all good, it's educational, but it's downright immoral to sell that to a client and drag them through it.

I'm not young, yet I don't find any of this all that bad.  
Maybe I'm an outlier, but I see refactoring and learning new tools as just keeping the blade sharp. Migrating to new frameworks, tools, etc. is just superficially iterative. I've yet to see some kind of massive paradigm shift blow me away and stress me out.

The sad thing is that in many cases working on such a system is a career killer. Nobody wants to hire you. Some years ago a colleague and I realized that our company wouldn’t hire us judging from the job descriptions because we worked on systems that had been working for years but weren’t shiny. Since then I always something new to every project. Not because it makes sense but because it’s good for the resume. Other groups are even worse. **Three devs writing 13 micro services on Kubernetes for maybe a thousand users ever**.

I maybe feel nostalgic, but the old ui is so much... Better :)

Mom taught me the basics (which vegetables become softer the soonest, how to rid a pepper of seeds, how to "clean" a chicken), everything else just went on from there. I started reading about it and watching some videos about basic concepts, such as how to manage fonds, pan sauces, proper meat temperatures...  
My picks for videos were Marco Pierre White, Alton Brown, Adam Ragusea and Kenji Lopez-Alt for the most part, especially because they have a "scientific" approach to it, explaining why things are done rather than just telling you to do it. That way, you understand what you're doing and how you can adapt a recipe to your tastes.  
I read "Salt Fat Acid Heat" and plenty of other books that focus on the "whys" of cooking, but "Salt Fat Acid Heat" has to be the one I reference the most.  
However, the most important thing that I was taught, by my mom, early on, is patience. A lot of dishes just don't end up well if you rush it, use higher temperatures than supposed to, and so on. Some mistakes in cooking can be fixed just by "cooking it off" or waiting, especially with sauces, soups and in some particular cases, meats. In the beginning, I burnt some pancetta ends and ended up undercooking chicken breasts by not using lower temperatures.  
The second thing that I learnt that I apply to most cooking, is that alcohol solves a lot of issues. Balsamic vinegar (even the cheap imitation ones) brightens up sauces that cooked for too long, wines/cognacs/vinegar deglaze pan fonds and help you manage the thin line between a lovely golden crust and burnt fond, white wines bring a degree of refreshment to "summery" dishes that is simply unbelievable, and above all, if you are patient, **you're able to rid cheap vinegars and wines of their acidness/sourness by cooking them**. This is why I avoid applying alcohol over the item that is being cooked. Instead, I follow the perimeter of the pan so it can seep underneath and cook off.

So I'm an early Gen X'er, and was one of the "latchkey kids". My mother had a horrible work schedule, my dad liked food but rarely cooked (mostly meat). Home-cooked food was usually throw-it-on-the-table sheet pan or one-pot dinners, made with exhaustion and anger. Occasionally, there'd be holiday and party trick dishes - fancier rolls, cakes, roasts, or sides that my mother kept to herself in the kitchen. We got carryout or ate in restaurants pretty often, so I had some sense that there was a world of cooking outside what I could taste at home.  
We had some fruit trees and berries, so I learned to make jellies, jam, applesauce, and pie filling. As far as feeding myself when the folks weren't home, I could make sandwiches, boil oatmeal, cook boxed pasta and canned soups, scramble eggs or make omelettes, and cut up vegetables to put a salad together. We still had a couple of Home Ec classes in school, so I could bake cookies and box-mix cakes. But not much else until I moved out.  
I lived in a vegetarian group house in college, so I cooked basic legumes, grains, pasta, and vegetables with my housemates. We were always broke and frugality was our ethos, so I learned how to salvage bruised or half-rotten produce, plan around bulk co-op purchases, cook for a dozen people at a time, make basic vegetable stocks, and preserve food. We put a lot of effort into seasonings to make cheap eats tasty, so that's when my knowledge of spices took off. We were mainly inspired by Indian and Japanese Buddhist cuisines, due to the variety of vegetarian dishes and college-town ingredients available.  
That's when I got curious and started to dig into cookbooks more. **Studying chemistry, it seemed like the distance between a lab prep and a recipe wasn't insurmountable, so I experimented with more ambitious dishes**. I had to realize that cooking ingredients aren't lab reagents - size, ripeness, moisture/fat/gluten, etc. content are all variable, and you won't get the same results with the "same" materials every time.  
When I got a decently paying job, I moved to an apartment with a few carnivore friends. That started me on meat cooking. Roasting a chicken, making pot roast, or stir-frying pork started me down the rabbit hole of classical and global cooking techniques. I also learned about dealing with a crappy apartment electric stove, after the commercial gas range in the group house.  
Since then, it was continuous exploration and practice. I started and stopped a few different careers. My first round of IT burnout happened to coincide with the publication of Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential. With that inspiration, and spouse's encouragement/Dot Com bubble money, I quit my job and went to culinary school.  
I was totally unprepared for the degree of technical mastery and speed required for commercial cooking, as well as the pathologies of professional kitchen culture. **I broke down in tears more than once**. Nonetheless, everything I learned there has served me well in every career since. The level of organization, discipline, precision, preparedness, and practice required for smoothly operating kitchens is extraordinary. You are 100% responsible for, and expected to be in control of, the outcome of your efforts.  
No cookbook will teach you these things - it's purely experiential learning. Working in a pro kitchen is part ballet and part jazz. You develop a proprioceptive sixth sense - where someone is moving hot pans behind you, what a smooth rhythm of prep, fire, plating feels like, how much time expires before you need to check doneness. You learn to use all your senses - what doneness looks like, smells like, sounds like, feels like, tastes like. It's an all-encompassing, sometimes overwhelming experience, seasoned with verbal and (fortunately rarely) physical violence.  
At that time, I also learned the performance arts of plating, table service, and beverage pairing. Again, restaurant world is a realm apart from home cooking. It's a business, so every choice has to be justified in the bottom line - food, time, rent, and other costs make or break the restaurant. As an example, **our butchery instructor patiently explained to us how to portion and prepare a $5 whole chicken as $100 worth of dishes**.  
Restaurant cuisine is also a competitive art form, so every aspect of performing service has to be considered: decor, napery, plates, cutlery, glassware, uniforms, frequency and language of waiting on the table, menu verbiage, timing of foods, pairings...  
I ultimately spent 7 years working in a patisserie café. We did catered pastries, wedding and event cakes, and special orders in addition to the bakery case. I loved the predictable routines, kitchen cameraderie, the play with new preparations on slower days and the rat-a-tat rhythm of the busy periods. But at the end, it's incredibly demanding physical work for meagre pay. You're lifting 80 - 100 lbs. dozens of times a day, constantly standing, alternately freezing or broiling, with hands often cramped for hours doing intricate decorations. A career in food service is best started and wrapped up while you're very young, and I wasn't that.  
I still break out those skills for fun now and then, but my home cooking now is mainly for the pleasure of eating good daily meals. Spouse and I trade off meal prep, making batches of recipes we think will be healthy and pleasing enough to eat for a few days, or freeze and pull out when we're tired. We've both got big enough repertoires that we rarely eat the same things twice. We've got space now for a garden, so there's also the delight of using what I've grown, fresh to the table or put up for winter.
