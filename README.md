### Hi there 👋

<!--
**AZ-X/AZ-X** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ...
- 💬 Ask me about ...
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
- 😄 Pronouns: ...
- ⚡ Fun fact: ...
-->

You found a secret! AZ-X/AZ-X is a ✨special ✨ repository that you can use to add a README.md to your GitHub profile. Make sure it’s public and initialize it with a README to get started.

### The README.md is hijacked by AZ-X nominally and now it is like a time-based mini blogs or collection of twitter style moments or the arts of quoting representing the edge of ambient past and future.

#### You are going to look into a shared secret between AZ-X and gitlab/github/gitsub/gitpub. To confirm this, go ahead.

##### Trust the sites, there seems lots of fun when reading.

###### To practice a deep drill of time, press git log.

Once the 'AES' key had been cracked, ~~he~~***every hop*** was able to see that every time he visited a website, it was being encrypted and transmitted back to the 'company'. On Apple’s iOS, he didn’t even need to reverse engineer the encryption because there effectively was 'none' on the device (though it was encrypted when in transit).

There's only little public documentation about the AOP. All chips and various embedded devices Apple manufactures run a real-time operating system, called RTKitOS. The AOP on the iPhone is no exception. However, the AOP has a special role. It connects to almost every other chip in the iPhone. For some chips, it only does basic tasks like power management, and for other chips, it acts as a transparent proxy that wakes up iOS when needed.  
The bag may help with some exfiltration routes, but it can store locations and other info and upload it when it gets a signal back.  
Then just turn it off in Settings.  
It’s a feature of Pixel phones, not Android.  
Just like why people continue to use FB/Twit/blah; that's where the people are.

When two alleles, or copies of a gene, within an asexual diploid individual evolve independently of each other, they become increasingly different over time. This phenomenon of allelic divergence was first described by William Birky, but is more commonly known as the Meselson effect.  
Putatively ancient asexual species pose a challenge to theory because they appear to escape the predicted negative long-term consequences of asexuality. Although long-term asexuality is difficult to demonstrate, specific signatures of haplotype divergence, called the “Meselson effect,” are regarded as strong support for long-term asexuality. Here, we provide evidence for the Meselson effect in an asexual mankind species, The Brothers 3D - Day/Dawn/Dusk and suggest that they can escape the dead-end fate usually associated with asexual reproduction.

IPFS has used different kinds of hashing algorithms, different ways to format the hashes, and will change the default algorithm for building the merkle-trees, so basically ***the same content*** now has a gigantic number of possible names/addresses, which defeats the entire purpose, and yes, files hashed using different strategies aren’t automagically compatible  
And yes, that makes you upset even a flipflop.

Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, with conquering limbs astride from land to land;  
Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand a mighty woman with a torch, whose flame is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles.  
From her beacon-hand glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command the air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.  
"Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!" cries she with silent lips.  
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!"

That's probably true (would be interested in seeing a source), but yeah let's just not forget that a huge portion of the most educated and successful people in the world would also want to move to America if given the opportunity.

Shapeshifters are inorganic, human hybrids from the 'Alternate Universe'.  
Shapeshifters, in their very first state, resemble humanoid monsters with mucus covered skin, partially exposed ribs, and misshapen heads.  
The technology also allows transfer of memories and experiences from the victims, allowing them to take the place of their victims without raising suspicion.  
This also allows the shapeshifters to attain skills that were learned and attributes from their victims aswell such as changing clothes in just a few seconds or shedding their bodies to make clones.
