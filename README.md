Why people use [mrustc](https://github.com/thepowersgang/mrustc) a.k.a. alternative rust compiler to build Firefox?  
Why people hate multiple Objective Caml builds?

Considering that BoringSSL is the library in Chrome, Android, iOS, and Google's GFE, I imagine it's adoption is not "poor". It is probably the most widespread TLS implementation, by traffic.

Why github show an example of [Deleted bot](https://github.com/ghost) talking about terms of 'blacklisting' or 'whitelisting' [ghostly](https://github.com/DNSCrypt/dnscrypt-proxy/issues/1654)  
Why ask to open a ghostliness discussion on such topic?

BlueKeep: Fragmentation and Aggregation Attaches since 1997, but what's the matter with an outdated Windows 7 machine??? How did you discover this? "That's a good question."

[thanks Thomas](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/) Whilst Americans may not have heard of the app, according to one analysis, it’s the fourth biggest browser by user numbers in the world, largely because of large user bases in Asia, but were hosted in the U.S.

Once the 'AES' key had been cracked, ~~he~~***every hop*** was able to see that every time he visited a website, it was being encrypted and transmitted back to the 'company'. On Apple’s iOS, he didn’t even need to reverse engineer the encryption because there effectively was 'none' on the device (though it was encrypted when in transit).

This is the lamest title i ever read  
Rust? what is that?  
1.55.0 why is that worth mentioning  
Is this an AD? or a news about an update?  
Why not mention it's an update and is a release note?  
or is ***Hacker News*** the place to release rust release notes so mentioning it would imply it is not  
Fishy fishy, when i hold your tail, you start to stray away, or not, doesn't make sense anyways, does it?

it's able to silently pull a *trove* of personal information without _any_ kind of user prompt  
All this data was being collected and available to an attacker even if “Share analytics” was turned off in ***settings***.” states the expert.  
```
func wifi_info() -> String? {
    let connection = xpc_connection_create_mach_service("com.apple.nehelper", nil, 2)
    xpc_connection_set_event_handler(connection, { _ in })
    xpc_connection_resume(connection)
    let xdict = xpc_dictionary_create(nil, nil, 0)
    xpc_dictionary_set_uint64(xdict, "delegate-class-id", 10)
    xpc_dictionary_set_uint64(xdict, "sdk-version", 1) // may be omitted entirely
    xpc_dictionary_set_string(xdict, "interface-name", "en0")
    let reply = xpc_connection_send_message_with_reply_sync(connection, xdict)
    if let result = xpc_dictionary_get_value(reply, "result-data") {
        let ssid = String(cString: xpc_dictionary_get_string(result, "SSID"))
        let bssid = String(cString: xpc_dictionary_get_string(result, "BSSID"))
        return "SSID: \(ssid)\nBSSID: \(bssid)"
    } else {
        return nil

There's only little public documentation about the AOP. All chips and various embedded devices Apple manufactures run a real-time operating system, called RTKitOS. The AOP on the iPhone is no exception. However, the AOP has a special role. It connects to almost every other chip in the iPhone. For some chips, it only does basic tasks like power management, and for other chips, it acts as a transparent proxy that wakes up iOS when needed.  
The bag may help with some exfiltration routes, but it can store locations and other info and upload it when it gets a signal back.  
Then just turn it off in Settings.  
It’s a feature of Pixel phones, not Android.  
Just like why people continue to use FB/Twit/blah; that's where the people are.
